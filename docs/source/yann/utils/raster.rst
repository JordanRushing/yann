.. raster:

:mod:`raster` - provides a visualization for rasterizing images.
================================================================

The file ``yann.utils.raster.py`` contains the definition for the rasters. This code is not mine and
is lifted from theano utils. This code is used to remove the dependency on now out-dated pylearn2 
library. Yann uses pylearn2's make_viewer to create images that are raster. Migrating to this 
tile_raster_images from theano tutorials. Obliging License, credit and conditions for Theano
Deep Learning Tutorials: This entire file was 
completely and directly reproduced from the theano deep learning tutorials.
